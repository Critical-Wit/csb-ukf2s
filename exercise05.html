        Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest
        tool in the shed. She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her
        thumb In the shape of an "L" on her forehead. Well, the years start
        coming and they don't stop coming. Fed to the rules and I hit the ground
        running. Didn't make sense not to live for fun; Your brain gets smart
        but your head gets dumb. So much to do, so much to see, So what's wrong
        with taking the back streets? You'll never know if you don't go. You'll
        never shine if you don't glow.

        Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play! Hey now, you're
        a rock star, get the show on, get paid! And all that glitters is gold!
        Only shooting stars break the mold!
