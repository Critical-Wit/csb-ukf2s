      <h3>Donations</h3>
      <p>FOPAL is open for drop-off donations, no appointment needed, 
        most weeks Monday-Saturday 3-5pm at our Main Room! Donations are not accepted the week preceding the sale; 
        for this month and next, that means donations will not be accepted Sunday October 3 through Monday October 11,
        nor Sunday November 7 through Sunday 14 November.</p>
      <p>Friends of the Palo Alto Library/FOPAL are located at 4000 Middlefield Rd.
          in the Cubberley Community Center/CCC. You’ll be delivering your books at FOPAL’s Main Room,
          the portable by the tennis courts using the CCC north entrance.</p>

      <p>Donors will be greeted outside FOPAL’s Main Room by a volunteer Donation Monitor(s)
          and asked to place donations in FOPAL’s banker boxes and then move the books/boxes up the 
          ramp to FOPAL’s Sorting Room. Sorting Room volunteers will help direct donors as to where
          to place the boxes and offer a receipt and a thank-you. 
          There will be a limit of six bags/boxes per donation.</p>  
      <p>No ephemera, electronics, art, records, music CDs, or plushies/stuffed animals will be accepted. 
        See the temporary list of what we do and do not accept at https://www.fopal.org/donate.</p>
      <p>FOPAL offers the use of hand trucks & carts if needed.</p>
