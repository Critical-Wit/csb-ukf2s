        This will be an alphabetized list of every game in my Nintendo Switch library. Titles that have been played to
        completion will be bolded. Games that do not have an "ending" will be italicized. These will be long lists, 
        and I would like to ultimately code them as an ordered list, and use the class tags to delineate the
        completed and incompleted games. I'm having a little trouble figuring out how to get the images to look the 
        way I want them to, so I'll be tweaking that a bit too. 
        Mostly, I wanted to add some content so I would have more to style for Exercise 6.
